1. VMBuilder creates VM instance, using VMConfig based on provided configuration file.

2. VMConfig parses configuration file:
    - memory
    - registers
    - screen
    - flags
    - instructions

3. Instruction definitions are parsed by VMParser. It creates instances of VMOp, which is built from several MicroOps (RPN or Conditional).
When VMOp is called, it executes every MicroOp it has. MicroOps are place where actual operation takes place.
When they are created, they decode information about their arguments for later use and create incomplete RPN, because it needs to be filled with actual variables' values.
Given collection of bytes, it initializes its arguments' values and using RPN_Calculator calculates result of RPN.

4. RPN_Calculator is not only calculator, but it can also call other functions based on RPN. (example: 2+3*func(1,2) -> 1, 2, func, 3, *, 2; calls func(1,2))
It maps string to functions of predefined form, it can be provided with custom functions, that can be used in instruction declarations.
